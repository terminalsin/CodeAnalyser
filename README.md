CodeAnalyser is a fully functional, micro-service based, downtime resilient code analyser for single class inputs with GPT and Static analysis capabilities. It was originally designed to be multi-permeable and cross-compatible amongst languages to maintain cross-language support since we're working with LLMs. Since then, we have additionally added experimental language support (although anything other than Java would either require to move the microservice infrastructure to Apache Zookeeper/Consul to support rust, etc...).

Overall, this application has the following features
- OpenAI GPT Support
- OLlama Llama 3 fallback if OpenAI is down
- Full code evaluation for any language (Java, JavaScript, Rust, etc...)
- Linting and display of suggestions according to type
- Scalable and deployable on demand
- Code storage with H2 Database
- Statistics page which displays average score and warning types

## Installation

### Requirements
To be able to deploy this, you will need the following:
- Docker (preferably LTS)
- Java JDK >= 17 

To deploy, one click command using Gradle

### Building

#### Windows
```bash
gradlew oneClickDeploy 
```

#### MacOS/Unix/Linux
```bash
./gradlew oneClickDeploy 
```

### Deploy
Once you have executed the previous step, you may deploy using the preset docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```

You may optionally add the parameter `-d` to run in a detached status. The frontend will be deployed to https://localhost:3000

### Troubleshooting

##### I did not deploy OpenAI, and it hangs on OLlama fallback!
<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

There's an incredibly easy fix for this. First lets diagnose the issue with the service: 
```
docker-compose logs llama-agent
```

If this outputs an error similar to this:

```
llama-agent-1  | java.lang.RuntimeException: [404] Not Found - {"error":"model 'llama3' not found, try pulling it first"}
llama-agent-1  |        at org.springframework.ai.ollama.api.OllamaApi$OllamaResponseErrorHandler.handleError(OllamaApi.java:78) ~[spring-ai-ollama-0.8.1.jar:0.8.1]
llama-agent-1  |        Suppressed: reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblyException:
llama-agent-1  | Error has been observed at the following site(s):
llama-agent-1  |        *__checkpoint ? HTTP POST "/generate" [ExceptionHandlingWebHandler]
```

Then you should run

```
docker-compose exec ollama ollama run llama3
```

</details>

## Modules
These are broken down into a microservice infrastructure, view the initial project graph below:

![Original infrastructure](./docs/og-infra.png)

This infrastructure has since involved, notably containing the following changes:
- Datastore was renamed to code-storage. Still uses MySQL in a h2 local database
- Mainframe was renamed to Shop, service discovery was created and called Mainframe
- Authentication cluster is now Supabase, an opensource derivative of Firebase

Overall, the following modules exist:
